Oxford Uni Programming Work

*Update* I am currently writing Python solutions to the ip (imperative programming) problem sheet questions originally for Scala, delving into differences between Python and Scala, and explaining my interpretation of the problem sheet questions and issues relating to them. I am doing this for an extra chellenge beyond my current coding bootcamp. The questions on the sheet are included as comments in the files and problem sheet questions with no code component have been excluded.


In this repository I have uploaded some of my programming from my university modules, though most of my work for university was paper-based and/or mathematical as opposed to programming. 

In this repo I have included programming tasks in weekly problem sheets as well as assessed practical coursework.
These solutions serve to represent my learning and improvement over time instead of provide model answers (though all practical code has been passed by the Department).
The tutorial questions and practical instructions are on the respective Oxford website pages for users with permission to access them.

My priorities are writing clean code that clearly resembles the underlying maths and writing code that is enjoyable to read by ordering and structuring my code in an intuitive way.
