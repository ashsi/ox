Oxford Uni Programming Work

In this repository I have uploaded some of my programming from my university modules.
This includes weekly problem sheets as well as assessed practical coursework.
Not all solutions are correct; these versions serve to represent my learning and improvement over time instead of provide model answers (though all practical code has been assessed and passed by the Department). This is in part because my corrected code, with answers to the questions I have commented, is on paper.
Some of the tutorial questions and practical instructions are on the respective Oxford website pages. I will unfortunately not republish them in my repository.
